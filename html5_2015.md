# Post processing
**Using post processing for faster development**

*Aaron Ladage*

- preprocessors were used to fix weird issues in languages
- proprocessors suck, compile time, proprietary etc
- use transpilers postcss, babel / tc instead

----------
## Preprocessors
### Things suck about the languages we use

- CSS: no variables, functions, importing, arethmetic (CSS sucks!)
- picture fill (polyfill for srcsets)
- pre processors and polyfills are used (things like SASS, CoffeeScript)

----------
## Preprocessors suck ,too

- they are proprietary languages
- must always be compiled, compile is slow,
- other issues, see slides

---------
## Postprocessors / transpilers ftw

- yes, they're preprocessors / transpilers
- you write in the standard language, transpiler backwards compats
- specify config file for what to support

# Monitoring
*for the masses*
[Rod Fernandez](https://github.com/rodfernandez)

---------
## Performance API

```js
// `performance` has monotonically increasing clock
let start = performance.now();
let elapsed = performance.now() - start;
start !== elapsed // true
```

```js
// however ...
var start = new Date().getTime();
var elapsed = new Date().getTime() - start;
start !== elapsed // true
```

```js
performance.mark('p:before');
// do things
performance.mark('p:after');
performance.measure('p', 'p:before', 'p:after');
performance.getEntriesByType('measure');
```

[do these things with ES6 decorators!](https://github.com/wycats/javascript-decorators)

----------
## Navigation time API

----------
## Resource Timing API

**mind blown**

```js
performance.getEntriesByType("resource");
// returns list of resources with URL and timings
```

----------
## Beacon API

yeah yeah

----------
----------
# WebCrypto APIs

*Daniel Roesler - Utility API*

[Examples](https://github.com/diafygi/webcrypto-examples)

- just allows access to crypto primitives in browser
- partially implemented

-------------

```js
window.crypto.getRandomValues();
window.crypto.subtle.genarateKey(); // and other key handling methods
window.crypto.subtle['sign' || 'verify' || 'digest']()
```

--------

- lots of things about encryption and decryption
- use sha256 hashing, AES-GCM for encrypt, decrypt
- HMAC or ECDSA for sign / verify
- ECDH for deriveBits/Key()

----------
---------
# Modern UI Development
### with Node.js

*Ryan Anklam, UI at Netflix*

tl;dr we can do universal JS with webpack and some config, so we should just do it

-----------
[an IIFE is a](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immediately-invoked_function_expression)

```js
(function () { /* do things*/ })();
```

---------
## about Classes

- UI components as classes
- let go of mixins and extends (because you'll silently overwrite)
- (but what's the alternative?)
- *everything is a component* - issue with maintenance?

---------
# lint all the things

- especially lint your CSS for deep nesting

----------

# javascript all the things

*unimorphic / isomorphic*

**universal**

- restful apis
- don't implement business logic in node
- *do* implement display logic in node
- hyrdating / dehyrdating is really hard with universal js


----------

# anti-patterns

```js
function isoFunction () {
    if (window.data) {
        let data = window.data;
    } else {
        let data = import('some/data')
    }
}
```

do this instead

```js
function contextResolver() {};

function isoFunction () {
    let data = contextResolver();
}
```

----------
# Webpackin'

web pack will shim node require stuff for client

# Javascript & the AST*

*Jared Overson - Shape Security*


<small>*abstract syntax tree</small>

-----------
# Browserify

- uses AST to find require calls and create bundles

```js
var modulename = 'jquery';
require(modulename); // fuu what happens?
```

---------
## ASTs

- use ASTs to find & refactor things instead of regexes
- [esquery](https://github.com/estools/esquery) is cool
- Esprima, Acorn, Shift are tree parsers
- Formats are Estree and Shift

------------
# Try it out

```js
let parsed = parse(sourcecode);

// convert this
(() => { return 2 })()

// to this
(function () { return 2})()
```

- use AST explorers to explore source
- basically need to output a transformed AST
- try "reducing" out the same AST you got in
- the many ways you can write fns make this shit *complex*

# VR & the Web

*Alt Space VR*

**Enabling the web for VR**

----------
## Opening up webpages in VR

Web pages need to have:

- true 3d objects, meshes, point clouds
- composable w/ other content, needs depth, blending etc
- needs input, mouse movements + eye tracking for gimbal moving
- skeletal tracking - content should know where you are in relationship
- syncronization - you need to be able to see what I see

----------
## Web in VR

- uses Three.js, Chromium, VR Client
- uses a "3d" window space, arbitrary API
- Three.js custom renderer
  - they needed context info for inputs (I clicked on thing)
  - instead of smth like "I clicked at X,Y,Z space"

----------
## Paradigm & Pattern

- trying to develop paradigm for things like skeleton info
- host anywhere, multi-platform
- trying to build standards for this stuff for VR headsets etc.
- need 90 frames per second on two cameras or nauseous!

# Asset packaging / serving in modern UIs

*Mike North*

-----------
## Clowntown

- some teams try to merge all code at end of sprint
- some write 4k lines of code, then try to get reviews!

-----------
## Canary releases

- 10% edge release with separate reporting etc.
- run the canary for 24hrs, then promote to GA
- I love the idea of automating this

-----------
## Deploying SPAs

- !!store index.html in redis
- shove other assets to CDN (yeah yeah)
- ?how do you deal with REST / missing resources?
- notify user of new version, down page, error pages
- ?why not cache index.html?
- seems like serving index from CDN is good idea

# When can I have Native Code?

*Brad Nelson, Google, CJM Goldman Hall*

Get more from the Web Platform

---------------
### Things missing from
# the web

- web currently doesn't give us "native code"
- Native client (NaCl)
- we need to be close to the metal
- threads + dynamic code gen

-----------
## Native

- Google NaCl runs machine code in browser
- safe, fast, efficient, secure
- like asm.js
- great for games, graphics intensive apps
- C++ -> client code (JS)
- avoid roundtrips to server, use client for processing
- allow dev to write / ship plugin for web

-----------
## Reuse Extensible

- Allow web dev to use C++ libs
- Reuse other widgets outside JS / HTML / CSS

-------------
## Solves code performance issues

- JS performance is plateauing
- DOM is slow now
- JS perf is inconsistent on same machine
- Native code does better GC
- Solution needs to match what web expects
   - hardened APIs
   - secure containers

-----------
## NaCl / Emscripten

- Uses sandbox in Chrome to keep things safe
- simd.js expose SSE/AVC/Neon to Web
   - fast array buffer manip, is stage 3 spec
- Shared ArrayBuffer, shared mem between workers, stg 1
   - need this for threads & postmessage is super slow
   - allows better concurrency models
- Web assembly, xbrowser bins, this is "not js", LLVM

# Welcome to Mordor!
#### Hunting Performance Issues and Memory Leaks in Node.js

*Daniel Khan, YCBA Screening Room*

----------
# What is Node.js

- C++ program w/ V8
   - Node bindings
   - V8, Thread Pool, Event Loop
- only good for middle tier, not for CPU tasks

-------
# Mem issues

- allocated, heap, used heap
- `process.memoryUsage()`
- V8 GC deallocs mem by keeping track of weak / no ref mem
- GC basically tracks a graph, walks it to dealloc mem
- two types of GC in V8
    1. mark sweep
    2. scavage / compact
- node-gc-profiler for insight

-----------
## Profiling V8 Mem

- V8 `profiler.takeSnapshot()`
- use chrome profiler to open, analyze heap snapshots

---------
## CPU Issues

- CPU intensive work will block main thread in Node.js
- Use flame graphs + call stack graphs
- `profiler.startProfiling(id); profiler.stopProfiling(id);`
- Again, use chrome profiler to open / analyze
- D3.js to visualize CPU profiles to sunburst (this is cool!)
- Sidenote: `NODE_ENV=production` reminder

----------
----------

## Look up

- a/b, jmeter, keynote, soasta for load testing
- futexes
- what if we stored our code in SC with ASTs instead of text?
- systemjs instead of webpack, jspm.io
- tsdb?
- pattern lab
- falkor paths
- asm.js / Native Client
