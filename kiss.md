# Understanding

# *not* simplicity

# is the goal

# **Simple things are good.**

There are many things in the world that are simple. They have few moving parts and few interlocking pieces.

# But complex things are also good.

cars, bridge stress dynamics, rocketry, the human body, gravity, international relations, tectonic forces

# *Simplicity or complexity are not end goals for quality code.*

Instead, the goal is **understanding**.

Quality code, like any good writing, knows it's audience and can be understood by that audience.
